# Running the project

1. Install dependencies in root level and on app-levels
2. Open terminal in root directory of project
3. `pnpm build`
4. Open second terminal in root directory of project
5. `pnpm serve`
6. (hopefully) it runs and watches for changes in all projects - only cold reload is available for changes in remote apps
